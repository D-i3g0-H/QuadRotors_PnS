%[text] # Class 2 - Drone Simulation
%[text] ## Learning Objectives
%[text] 1. Be able to simulate a general N-rotor vehicle for the purpose of testing and tuning controller and estimator designs.
%[text] 2. Be able to explain how flight performance is affected by changes in the parameters of the N-rotor vehicle, for example mass, centre of gravity location, propeller aerodynamics. \

%[text] ## Preparation
%[text] - Read through Section 3.1.2 which provides a brief explanation of the Simulink template provided for this exercise sheet.
%[text] - You should also read through the comments in the file [exercise01\_simulation\_parameters.m](file:exercise01_simulation_parameters.m) for hints and to understand what variables are available for use in the Simulink model. \
