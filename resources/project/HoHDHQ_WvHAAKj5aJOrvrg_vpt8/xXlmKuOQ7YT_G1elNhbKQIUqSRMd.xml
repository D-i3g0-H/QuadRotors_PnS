<Info description="Quad-rotors are becoming more and more commonplace as technological advancements increase capabilities and reduce costs. Quad-rotor vehicles are encountered both for domestic entertainment and industrial applications, some examples are: toys for people of all ages, professional cinematography, or, inspection of industrial scale structures and processes. One reason why quad-rotors have become so pervasive is their mechanical simplicity, which lends itself to the high operational reliability. Moreover, the control and estimation techniques required to stabilise a quad-rotor around hover utilises only the control theory taught to under-graduates, while acrobatic feats and fleet manoeuvres inspire many directions in current research.&#10;&#10;The learning objectives of this course are:&#10;- Be able to derive the continuous-time equations of motion for a general N-rotor vehicle,&#10;- Be able to simulate a general N-rotor vehicle for the purpose of testing and tuning controller and estimator designs,&#10;- Be able to explain how flight performance is affected by changes in the parameters of the N-rotor vehicle, for example mass, centre of &#10;  gravity location, propeller aerodynamics,&#10;- Be able to explain why a quad-rotor design allows the control architecture to be de-coupled into a collection of separate simple controllers,&#10;- Experienced the challenges of tuning a PID and/or LQR controller for achieving stable hover of a quad-rotor, both in simulation and on the &#10;  real-world system,&#10;- Be able to write C++ code for implementing a PID and/or LQR controller."/>
